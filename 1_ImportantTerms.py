'''Some Important terms
------------------------
------------------------

1. Identifier
--------------
An identinfier is a name having a few letters, numbers and special
character _ (underscore).
it should always start with a non- numeric character.
it is used to identify a variable, function, symbolic constant, class etc.

Python is a case sensitive programming language.
eg: d is not = D

KEYWORDS OR RESERVERD WORDS
-----------------------------

Python language uses the following keywords which are available to users to use them as identifiers.

1.False     2.await     3.else      4.import        5.pass
6.None      7.break     8.except    9.in            10.raise
11.True     12.class    13.finally  14.is           15.return
16.and      17.continue 18.for      19.lambda       20.try
21.as       22.def      23.from     24.nonlocal     25.while
26.assert   27.del      28.global   29.not          30.with
31.async    32.elif     33.if       34.or           35.yield

2. Constants
--------------
A constant is an identifier whose value cannot be changed throughout the execution of a program whereas the variable value keeps on changing.
There are no constants in Puthon, the way they exist in C and java.
In Python, It is not possible to define constant whose value can not be changed.
In Python, Constants ate usually defined on a module level and written in all capital letters with undrscores separating words but remember its value can be changed.

3. Variable
-------------
A Python variable is a reserved memory location to store values. In other words, a variable in a python program gives data to the computer for processing. Every value in Python has a datatype. Different data types in Python are Numbers, List, Tuple, Strings, Dictionary, etc.

Rules---
1.Every variable name should start with alphabets or underscore(_).
2.No spaces are allowed in variable declaration.
3.Except underscore(_) no other special symbol are allowed in the middle of the variable declaration
4.A variable is written with a combination of letters, numbers and special character _ (underscore)
